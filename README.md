Haven't discover your passion? Your dreamjob? Figure out what you were born to do with DreamJobber!


Business Understanding
For a lot of people, including myself,  figuring out what you want to do as a career is a difficult task, most especially for young individuals. There are also many new jobs and fields emerging that you may not have knew of and could possibly be your dream job. I want to create a simple application that requires a user to take a short quiz about their interest etc, and give recommendations of possible dream jobs, this will give the user direction in making some important life decisions.  





Deployment
The model will be deployed as a Flask app with a user friendly interface. The user will simply answer a series of questions and it will output some recommended jobs, top 10 perhaps. Bonus would be some job details like avg salary, education, etc.
